A tool/library to allievate the pain of bindings of Java/ObjC/Swift for Xamarin toolchain
Since I know a lot of Java and only a bit Objective C (The second worst language ever made, only beaten to by PHP), so the initial focus would be around Android/Java. 

Current thought is to use Java's annotation processor and interface, etc to do the job. It also may involve using C#'s attribute and IL weaving framework Fody on Xamarin side.
